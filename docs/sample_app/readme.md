# Sample App
This is a sample application that invokes the jz-gamification-engine to add goals and track user progress towards goals.

To run the app, perform the following:

```
cd ROOT_DIR
npm install // run this at root project directory, not sample_app directory!
cd docs/sample_app
npm install
npm start
// ... wait to start and then
// navigate to http://localhost:31854/static
